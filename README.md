Xamarin Android app, user needs to register or login(if he has an account) to access ads of cars. There he can list all of posts or he can add new post. When he list all posts he can enter to one of the posts and edit or delete it if that post is his, if that post isn't posted by him he will get message that he can't edit or delete that post. User can also add a comment to the post or go to filters, where he can filter posts by brand and year. Connection to the MS SQL Server is done by using API.
